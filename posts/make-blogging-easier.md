# Make blogging easier

Blogging can be hard. Blogging can be easy. Here are my mental rules for making it easier:

 1.	**Find a workflow that you enjoy**
 
	I didn't enjoy Wordpress.com. It did everything in its power to foil me at every turn. Now that I can write posts in Notepad++, my favourite editor ever, and with [CommonMark](./commonmark-and-markdown), it's just a joy! I wanna write about every tiny little thing!
	
 2.	**No post is too short**
 
	Go easy on yourself. If a blog post has to be a masterpiece, you won't ever post one.
	
 3. **Don't worry about readership**
 
	Just forget 'em. Blog for you. [Blog as an extension of your brain][1]. (Read the comments on that page)
	
 4.	**Post when you write**
 
	Don't worry about making two posts on the same day. Don't queue 'em up, just post! This bullet point could equally be called "Don't worry about your metrics".
	
 5. **Blog when you solve a problem**
 
	Software developers, handimen, experts - this one's for you.
	
 6.	**Keep notes**
 
	They're easy to turn into a blog later. OneNote. Evernote.
	
--------

That's the end! I might extend this post at a later date :)
