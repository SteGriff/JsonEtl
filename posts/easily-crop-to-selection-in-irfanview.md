# Easily crop to selection in Irfanview

![Crop selection in Irfanview](./posts/irfanview/crop-in-irfanview.png)

I like to have Photoshop installed on my PCs if possible, but at work it isn't. So for most of those common image editing tasks, I use Irfanview!

 - In Irfanview, you can click and drag on an image to create a selection border;
 - Once you have a region selected, press `Ctrl+Y` to crop.
 
That's all! Hope it helped.
