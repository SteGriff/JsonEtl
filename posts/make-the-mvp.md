# Make the MVP

MVP means Minimum Viable Product (among other things). The minimum viable product is the first build that does something useful/fun (depending on what your user was going for).

I like to compare this to Petri Purho's advice, "[build the toy first][1]". Petri spent a long time making games in 7 days, and often found that building a "toy" -- something that was fun in an unstructured way -- was a great gateway to making a finished product.

Here are a few reasons I can think of:

 * Early gratification leads to motivation
 * Motivation leads to progress
 * Progress leads to completion
 
So my tip of the day is "make the MVP"! Just make a thing! You can do it!
