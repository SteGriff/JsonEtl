# Upblog

Upblog is a website system. The site/blog is generated from pages/posts which you write in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
You write an HTML template to present all of your pages, and tell it where to put your post content, the page title, and the navbar... everything else is automatic!

## What's cool about Markdown?

 * You can read the source files really easily.
	 - Go and look at the [source file for this post](./posts/about-upblog.md)!
	 - That means the posts are forwards compatible; you can easily change them to another format in the future.
 * It's easy. You don't have to mess with a rich text editor or HTML, but you *can* do either if you want!
 
## What's cool about Upblog?

 * There's no database!
 * Your file structure organises your blog posts
 * You don't have to add any metadata - it's all in the file (and its properties...)
 * It runs on practically any cheap webserver, because it runs on PHP
 * [Upblog belongs to everyone](http://github.com/stegriff/upblog) (because I put it in the Public Domain)
