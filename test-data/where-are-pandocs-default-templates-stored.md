# Where are Pandoc's default templates stored

On Windows, you can find the default templates for Pandoc in:

	C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\pandoc\templates

So the default HTML template would be 

	C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\pandoc\templates\default.html

I initially could not find it there on my work PC because I was looking in the user `ste` and not `stephen`, which is my domain user (just in case you make a similar mistake :) )
