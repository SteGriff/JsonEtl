# Allow password storage in Filezilla

![Save passwords in Filezilla](./posts/filezilla/allow-password-save.png)

I turned off password saving when I set up Filezilla. Recently I got sick of having to type in FTP passwords every time, so I wanted to re-enable the option to remember passwords.

You can find it in `Edit | Settings | Interface`; in the Behaviour group, un-tick the box "Do not save passwords". Now you can once again have passwords stored for each FTP server!
