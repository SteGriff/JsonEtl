# IIS Error 500.19 when web.config is fine

This article affects you if IIS is showing an HTTP 500.19 error with Error Code `0x8007000d`, but your web.config file looks well formed. A special indicator is that the 'Config source' section just says: `-1: 0:`.

## Solution

This is probably happening because your `web.config` makes use of an extension which is not installed. Commonly this is [URL Rewrite](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite). You can either delete the config values for each extension until your site is accessible, or install the extensions. 

	<system.webServer>
		...
		<rewrite>
			<!-- I am the offending config section! -->
			<rules>
				...
			</rules>
		</rewrite>
