# SIGN

![Sign logo](./posts/sign/sign-logo.png)

I made a little service for fun at the end of 2014. I wanted one of those scrolling LED displays, but built this instead as a solution which can use any small screens you have lying around.

Check out [sign.me.uk](http://sign.me.uk) if you want to try it. It doesn't have user accounts, so anyone can jump in and try it.

## Ups

 * I like the passcode system for editing signs. It's naturally collaborative, and it lets the service "not care" about users. Essentially every sign is a user.
 * I wrote some javascript to resize the sign text to the screen and it works... most of the time
 * Graphically the site is OK, right? And the responsive design is handmade. It looks very bold and fresh on most smartphones.
 * It works on my Sony smart TV :)
 
## Downs

 * Sadly, the service seems to freak out on some phones, but I'm not sure why. Also, it used to work on my Windows Phone with IE11 but now it doesn't?? What changed?
 * It's easy to lose a sign passcode, but at least you can just start a new one!
 
SIGN is kind of in the vein of these snapchat-twitter-secret services which are very ephemeral. If you like it, tell someone about it :) Thanks for reading!
