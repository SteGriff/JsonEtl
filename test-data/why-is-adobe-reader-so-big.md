# Why is Adobe Reader so big?

Because it has a lot of features made to let Adobe's corporate customers get better value out of you! This post is inspired by a [comment about Adobe Reader by howardhus on Reddit][1].

"Adobe Reader" is not just a PDF reader. At the pro tier, it has a massive [feature list][] featuring gems such as:

 * Send and track documents online (implies a complete built-in mail server)
 * Collect e-signatures from others and track responses in real time (real-time engagement tracking)
 * Turn scanned paper documents into instantly editable PDFs (OCR)
 * Enhance PDF forms and connect to databases with JavaScript (a complete JavaScript parser?!)
 * Convert web pages to interactive PDFs, complete with links (a complete web browser, in fact!)
 * Mark PDFs with stamps, such as "approved" or "draft" (a full version control system)
 * Add audio, video, and interactive objects to PDFs (multiple media players)

## The catch

**Beware!** The free reader doesn't give *you* the power of these features. As the original commenter deftly puts it:

> Merely displaying PDFs is one function out of 100. To you as the consumer, it's the bait... but the system behind it is what Adobe sells to its corporate consumers.
> They say: "You want a full fledged content tracking system? We got it... and the best part is **all your customers have the clients already installed!** in the form of Adobe Reader".

This is the shady reason you're downloading 500 MB of software just to open PDF files.

## What you can do

If you want to free up space and cut Adobe's install base for their massive metrics platform, here's what you can get instead:

 * Firefox user? You already have a decent PDF reader; just set Firefox as your default application for opening PDFs. But beware it prints certain types of diagram incorrectly! :(
 * Download [Evince][], a multi-format reader, only 32MB. Built for Linux and now ported to Windows. The advantage over other reader downloads is that it doesn't come with junkware included!
 * Download [Foxit reader][] but be aware of unticking all of the junkware in the installer! It's a 42MB download (but it also comes from a slower download server).

Thanks for reading! Tweet me @SteGriff, and enjoy using better software!
